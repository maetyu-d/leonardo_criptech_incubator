Image 1  
![][image1]  
The image shows the trails of a population of bots as they move around a circular, 2-D world. There is a dense circular network of fine lines, radiating outwards from a bright orange centre into a surrounding field of bright green filaments. The orange centre area is tightly packed, suggesting a point of high, focused activity, and it then extends out as a kind of streak towards the right side, angled slightly downwards. Moving towards the edges of the image, the lines are far more often green, more tangled, messy, and dispersed, forming a roughly spherical shape against a black background. The overall structure resembles a data network, particle simulation, or neural map, with a clearly gradiated density that changes from a concentrated, mainly orange core to a relatively diffuse, main green outer region.

Image 2  
![][image2]  
The image shows a dense, square-shaped network made up of thousands of intersecting orange and green lines on a black background. Several bright clusters of orange lines appear as focal points, from which both orange and green lines radiate outward in many directions. The green lines form looping, tangled paths that fill almost the entire frame, overlapping and crossing repeatedly. The orange lines are more direct, much straighter, and concentrated near the bright clusters, suggesting areas of higher activity or connection. The overall effect is that of a complex, layered web or map with multiple centers of intensity spreading through a grid-like field.

Image 3  
![][image3]  
The image features a dense, swirling field of motion, made up of thousands of overlapping lime green and amber-orange lines \- the trails of bots inscribed across a deep, black background. The green lines are typically thinner, nervous, and darting, looping freely around the edges like unstable electrical signals, while the orange lines are generally thicker (the result of multiple lines being overlaid in close proximity) and more forceful, gathering heavily toward the centre. Where the two colours intersect, they create a bright, hazy yellow core \- an almost glowing mass where a great many paths collide and blend. From this luminous centre, trails seem to shoot outward in every direction, thinning into wandering curls and tangled knots that sprawl to the edges of the frame. The whole composition feels restless, as though capturing the long-exposure traces of many unpredictable agents moving at once. The overall sensation is of turbulence, energy, and chaotic motion, with no clear beginning or end \- just variously contrasting and overlapping colour and movement suspended in darkness.

Image 4  
![][image4]  
The image features a dense, chaotic web of orange and green lines on a black background. The orange lines form sharp, angular structures that crisscross diagonally through the center, creating overlapping triangular and rectangular shapes. In contrast, the green lines are looser and more fluid, looping and curling irregularly around and between the orange shapes. The composition feels layered and tangled, with the orange lines suggesting rigid frameworks or trajectories and the green lines appearing more organic and dispersed. Overall, it resembles a complex network or collision of geometric and freeform motion within a confined square space.

Image 5  
![][image5]  
The image shows a dense, circular formation of orange and green lines against a black background. At the center is a bright, tightly packed orange core made up of countless fine lines crossing and overlapping. From this central area, green lines extend outward in all directions, gradually spreading and becoming more tangled and irregular toward the edges. The overall structure resembles a burst or diffusion pattern — concentrated and energetic in the middle, more chaotic and dispersed at the periphery. The green lines create a soft, textured halo around the orange center, giving the image a strong sense of depth and outward motion.

Image 6  
![][image6]  
The image shows a dense rectangular cluster of orange lines at the center, surrounded by a thick layer of tangled green lines that radiate outward in all directions. The orange region is compact and intensely textured, with many overlapping strokes forming a solid, glowing block. Around it, the green lines twist and loop outward, creating a fuzzy, irregular border that gradually becomes more diffuse toward the edges. The overall composition has a strong central focus, with the orange core suggesting concentrated energy or structure and the surrounding green filaments giving a sense of motion and dispersion.

Image 7  
![][image7]  
The image displays a black background overlaid with a network of geometric shapes and straight lines in green and orange. Each shape appears as a small polygon or cluster of triangles, with multiple thin lines radiating outward from its center in all directions. The green and orange lines frequently intersect, forming dense starburst or web-like patterns.  
Some shapes are connected to one another by longer, angular lines, creating a loose network that extends across the entire image. The overall arrangement is irregular but balanced, with clusters of shapes distributed throughout the frame and areas of denser connectivity interspersed with more open space. The image has a technical or diagram-like quality, resembling a stylised visualisation of a network or data system.

Image 8  
![][image8]  
The image consists of a black background with a densely packed orange wireframe structure occupying most of the central area. The structure is composed of numerous straight lines forming interconnected geometric shapes, including cubes, hexagons, and diagonal cross-braces. The lines overlap heavily, creating a layered, mesh-like effect. Distributed throughout and around this orange structure are multiple green circular and spiral forms of varying sizes. These green elements are less densely arranged and appear to be positioned both within and outside the main orange cluster. The composition is symmetrical along no clear axis, with the orange structure concentrated in the center and the green shapes more dispersed toward the edges. The image gives the impression of a three-dimensional lattice viewed from an oblique angle.

Image 9  
![][image9]  
The image shows a cluster of intersecting lime green and amber-orange lines set against a pure black background. The structure they imply is architectural and grid-like, as though many separate movements have been forced into a shared, rigidly walled, three-dimensional structure. At the centre is a dense block of orange strokes, layered so heavily that they form a textured, almost woven core. Threading through and around this are sharper, straighter green lines (showing the different routes that green bots are forced to take compared to the most efficient routes of orange bots) that give the whole shape a mechanical, skeletal rhythm, like circuitry or scaffolding. The structure widens toward the middle, then narrows at the top and flares at the bottom, creating an abstracted silhouette reminiscent of a stacked tower, or a vibrating hive. At the lower edge, green and orange lines shoot outward in brisk, angular directions, like a breaking free from the containment of the structure. The overall sensation is of two visually distinct kinds of constrained movement and energy.

# Alt Text for Simulations

Simulation 1 

The overall layout suggests a technical simulation and the graphical user interface (GUI) has a dark theme with cyan-accented sliders, checkboxes, and buttons arranged along the top in a control panel. Several user-adjustable parameters are visible, including Speed, Trail width, Trail Opacity, Wobble, Fatigue, Avoid-Threshold, and Left-Bias. There are also options to follow either the lead (first spawned) Green or Orange bot, toggle the visual trails, accessibility score overlay, and bot goals on or off, and buttons labeled Pause, Reset, Save Trails PNG, and Apply. The main simulation area is located below the control panel, and displays a grid of tiles in varying shades of grey, representing the environment. To the right is a minimap showing a higher-level, zoomed-out view of the world. It includes a small rectangular frame and small coloured dots and trails \- coloured green and orange \- corresponding to the two bots. Below the minimap, a text panel titled DSL (Domain-Specific Language) lists configuration data and parameters such as world size, tile count, and camera coordinates that can (optionally) be reprogrammed by the user. 

Depending on the number of bots and their position relative to the camera, a series of trails may run across the main simulation area, indicating the movement path of one or more bots. The green trails, produced by the green bots, are typically curved, wobbly, and slightly uneven. As the Wobble and Left-Bias slider values are increased, these properties become more pronounced. Unless reprogrammed by the user, the orange trails, produced by the orange bots, are noticeably straighter (reflecting their more efficient paths), more stable, and less varied. 

Simulation 2

The graphical user interface (GUI) is multi-paneled and technical or scientific instrument-like, dominated by two rectangular panes that anchor the layout visually. These each show a different view of a greyscale, pixelated noise field that functions as an abstract spatial substrate. The left pane provides a magnified, high-resolution view in which any bot in focus and any bots nearby are seen in relative close-up. The right pane is smaller and presents a zoomed-out, minimap-like view of the world. Across these panes, small arrow head-like bots \- green and orange \- trace their distinct paths, their differing motion made legible through contrastingly ordered and disordered trails (respectively) that both stand out against the rigid, modular grid beneath. 

The surrounding UI elements form a contrasting layer of ordered typographic structures including state indicators, linear sliders, and uniformly spaced control clusters. In the lower left corner, a data panel and a compact line graph showing collective/overall sensor input by bot type add a feeling of precise scientific measurement, contrasting with the more freely gestural movement of the main visual panes above. Towards the lower right corner, a paint brush control enables the user to influence green bot behaviours by modifying the make-up of the greyscale substrate which they sense and respond to.

Simulation 3

The upper portion of the screen is dominated by a large, semi-transparent charcoal-grey interface panel that spans most of the screen’s width. It contains clear white text and a series of dropdown menus, buttons, and horizontal sliders that enable the user to adjust the parameters of the simulation and thus the behaviours of the bots. The top row includes a rule preset selector set to “Free roam” by default, a world selector set to “Circle” by default, and a “Clear trails” button. Beneath these are several labelled sliders, each with blue handles and thin white tracks. Specifically, there are options for adjusting trail thickness, trail transparency, limping amount, asymmetric instability, spinout rate, spinout duration, and spin magnitude. Each slider’s value is shown to the right, and at the bottom of the panel a compact line of summary text displays all current settings. The panel floats over the visual field without obscuring it entirely, giving the sense of an active, tunable system.

Below this interface, and filling the entire (circular by default) world boundary, is a dense and intricate web of light-trails drawn by simulated bots as they roam. The background is almost black, making the trails appear vivid and glowing. Two main colours dominate: bright neon green and warm amber-orange. The green trails twist, wobble, curl, and loop chaotically, suggesting lively, unstable movement, while the orange trails follow more angular, zig-zagging paths with occasional smooth curvature. Layered together, they create something like a tangle of fibres, or the captured motion of particles in a bubble chamber \- overlapping, intersecting, and drifting across the world space. The effect is of a two-tone mesh of motion imprinted over time at scale, and the sense of hundreds of tiny bots weaving an ever-thickening tapestry of paths.

Simulation 4

The top edge of the screen contains a long, thin, and horizontally-oriented user interface (UI) bar consisting of a series of pill-shaped badges. These badges sit against a dark charcoal background and utilise pale grey monospace text. Towards the left side these badges each display a fundamental piece of information and towards the right side they show a key control: the four available views (isometric, top-down, and two follow-cam modes), keyboard shortcuts for resetting, time scaling, toggling the DSL (Domain Specific Language) editor, and switching between 3D and 2D world generation. Two other badges hold number fields that let the user set how many green and orange bots are active, while the “Time ×1” badge and the “Mode: 3D” badge behave like clickable switches. When the Legend or DSL editor are opened, they appear as floating dark panels with thin borders, rounded corners, and bright, readable typography. Overall, the UI looks compact, minimal, and engineered to stay out of the way while still offering quick control over the simulation’s complexity.

Below this UI, the world is shown in four quadrants (a split-screen view), each rendering a different perspective on a vast procedural city made of thin, glowing wireframe lines. In the top-left quadrant, an isometric 3D view shows long straight streets, stacked rectangular buildings, and elevated sky bridges \- all drawn as delicate outlines, like a blueprint rendered on an old computer. Through this wireframe world, the bots wander and leave behind bright trails of greens and oranges suspended slightly above the ground plane. The trails are luminous, thin, and continuous, forming swirling loops, zig-zags, and wandering arcs as the bots travel through streets, climb ramps, or rest. In the top-right quadrant, these paths appear as dense scribbles mapped over the grid of the city, like motion traces from a scientific experiment. In the follow-bot views (bottom-left and bottom-right quadrants), the trails tighten into more intimate, nested spirals that reveal how differently the green and orange bots move \- one wobbling and asymmetrical, the other smooth and more efficiently direct. Together, the four perspectives create a multi-faceted, almost prismatic sense of movement and complexity, making the city feel alive with constantly shifting bot trajectories.

Simulation 5

At the very top of the screen, a thin line of glowing green text runs horizontally, like a scrolling data ribbon. At the bottom of the screen, another line of text, orange this time, scrolls across at a different rate. On the left side of the screen, a rectangular panel displays a vertical list of names and categories in a green monospace font \- each item spaced evenly, like article titles or encyclopaedia entries. This is almost mirrored on the right side, but this right-side structure employs a warm orange rather than green font, giving the two lists a contrasting, dual-channel appearance. Behind each side panel floats a faint geometric wireframe structure composed of translucent cubes in wireframe: the style is the same but the structures are different on each side, determined by the respective side’s word list. Taken together, these elements give the page a balanced, almost-but-not-quite-symmetrical layout.

These elements around the edges of the screen frame a deep black background while, in the centre of the screen, a dense graph glows softly in white, with hundreds of tiny nodes arranged across a globe-like form. This globe is orbited by a green satellite-like object that has a swooping and sometimes erratic path and leaves a green trail behind it, and by a similar orange object that has a much neater and steadier path and leaves an orange trail. Wherever these objects land on the globe, more nodes and connections are spawned and formed. Some nodes are highlighted with greens and oranges, suggesting active elements or points of interest within the network. The lines connecting nodes arc smoothly with gentle curvature rather than abrupt angles, giving the entire structure an organic quality. The globe is generally at its most dense in the middle, where connections overlap in a bright knot of white, and connections are generally more sparse near the edges.
